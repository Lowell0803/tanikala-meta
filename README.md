A blockchain-based voting system for Bulacan State University to enhance the security, reliability, and transparency of its student government elections.

By integrating blockchain into the voting system, this project addresses the common issues found in traditional voting systems:

- **Security** â€“ Protects voter privacy by ensuring all votes are anonymous and untraceable.

- **Reliability** â€“ Guarantees accurate vote recording and secure storage, preventing tampering, deletion, or unauthorized modification.

- **Transparency** â€“ Enables voters to verify that their votes were counted through transaction receipts, allowing independent verification of election results without compromising privacy.

## Deployment

This website was deployed in [Render](render.com) over the duration of 2 months for the Thesis defense. But, after that, the deployment was discontinued to save costs.  

## Environment Variables

Refer to the file `.env.setup.guide` for info about the environment variables.
## FAQ

### 1. What blockchain technology did you use?
- We used Polygon, a scaling solution built on top of Ethereum. Polygon is designed to make blockchain transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient, which makes it well-suited for voting systems.
### 2. How was the blockchain deployed in this project?
- The blockchain component was deployed on the Amoy Testnet, which is a test network used for development and experimentation.
### 3. Is this the actual repository used in the project?
- No. This is a meta repository intended for public viewing and documentation purposes only. It does not contain the complete or production-ready source code.
### 4. How can I run the full system?
- This meta repository does not include all the components necessary to run the system. If you require access to the full implementation (for academic or research purposes), please contact us at the emails below.
